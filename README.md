2022-2023 DevCatalyst Project

State all of your names and your school and let us know what each of you worked on. 

Especially include details where you went above and beyond for the project. 

Did you have any difficult problems that you had to overcome? 

Did you create custom images or videos for your client? 

Did you discover that you love coding? Let the judges know! 

There are no requirements for this section other than your name and 
your school, but it is to your advantage to give a little information about yourself.
