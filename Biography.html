  <p> My name is Derald Swain. I am the Criminal Justice Instructor here at CCHS.  
  I graduated from CCHS in 2000 and pursued a career in the United States Army. 
  I served 8 years on active duty and obtained my degree in Criminal Justice while serving overseas. 
  I returned home to pursue a civilian career in the criminal justice field. 
  I served as Director of Security for a 4 year university and later as a probation officer. 
  Before teaching, I worked with at risk teenagers teaching them how to live independently. 
  This is what started my passion and love for working with teenagers.  
  I am currently serving in the Army National Guard alongside teaching. 
  I have a beautiful wife and 4 amazing children.  </p>
