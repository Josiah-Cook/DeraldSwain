  <p class="flex-item"> My name is Derald Swain. I am the Criminal Justice Instructor here at CCHS.  
    I graduated from CCHS in 2000 and pursued a career in the United States Army. 
    I served 8 years on active duty and obtained my degree in Criminal Justice while serving overseas. 
    I returned home to pursue a civilian career in the criminal justice field. 
    I served as Director of Security for a 4 year university and later as a probation officer. 
    Before teaching, I worked with at risk teenagers teaching them how to live independently. 
    This is what started my passion and love for working with teenagers.  
    I am currently serving in the Army National Guard alongside teaching. 
    I have a beautiful wife and 4 amazing children.  </p>
